No Nonsense Designer License Agreement
--------------------------------------

Normally to get access to source code there is a humongous license 
agreement to read, with a bunch of legal mumbojumbo. To combat this I 
(Andreas/Arcidas) have written this "slimline"-gentleman's agreement to 
ensure that everyone understands what is acceptable and required of each 
designer prior to gaining access to the source code.

Why !?
* Allow for a late change of actual OS-license 
* Licensing in existing product not validated 
* Allow for dual-license (AGPL+BSD) 


You Agree to
* You will not distribute any information, source code or opinions without
  the approval from the board 
* You are responsible to ensure that all your submissions is your own and 
  you own all copyright & other rights (IPR) (DON'T CUT AND PASTE FROM 
  OTHERS CODE) 
* You release all claims & copyright on all your submissions to the 
  consortium 
* If you are uncertain about anything, ask the respective poc for the 
  area 
* the board has the final saying 


Everyone that have access to the SVN, agrees to the NNDL.
